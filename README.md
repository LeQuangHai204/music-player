# Music Player GUI Program
Welcome to my first programming project! This project showcases a graphical user interface designed for selecting and playing songs from specific albums, as well as creating playlists of favorite tracks.

### Disclaimers:
- Gosu library for Ruby is require to run the program
- The program is a work in progress and may contain bugs. I've intentionally left some issues unresolved to demonstrate my learning journey rather than delivering a fully functional program.
- There's currently no error handling mechanism implemented, so the program may crash unexpectedly under certain conditions, such as when clicking buttons or if the interface disappears.
- To use the program, music files must be placed in a folder named "sounds" within the same directory, and they must be in the ".wav" format. Additionally, to create playlists, an empty folder named "playlists" needs to be created within the same directory.
- The code doesn't adhere to many best practices for maintenance and scalability.
- The program's logic is rudimentary and contains hard-coded elements that may not be suitable for larger-scale applications.
